- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vasilica1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a web development career.

My name is Cernovschi VasilicÄƒ, I graduated Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, specializing in Automation and Applied Informatics. I am currently working part-time at a security company called Coral-Security where I run and maintain security systems. I am an easy-going, communicative, positive person and I like to learn new things every day. A year ago, I completed a programming course where I solved over 150 programming exercises. This course was helpful for me because I learned the basics of programming and certain algorithms that can be applied in any programming language.
I am interested in a web developer career because I want to change my activity area and because I am passionate about computer science. I am attracted by the opportunities that a programmer has, such as promoting and learning new things every day.  

2018-2022 -> Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science- Automation and Applied Informatics  

- I have gained hardware and software knowledge  
- I learned c/c++, Database, Java (Object-Oriented Programming OOP)
